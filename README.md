## Goals vs. Preferred Reality

As I've gotten older, I have strayed further away from the practice of setting goals. There is undoubtedly still immense value inherent in setting direction for your life. I don't want that truth to be lost in this essay. My reasoning behind reframing this encapsulation around life direction from "goals" into "preferred reality" is that there are flaws inherent in goal-setting. In goal-setting and goal-achieving, a typical sequence of events would go as follows: you set a goal $\rightarrow$ you work towards this goal with industry $\rightarrow$ goal is achieved or not achieved. Assuming a goal is achieved, the following happens. In the best case, this means you will allow yourself to enjoy a brief moment of satisfaction and maybe even fulfillment if you're lucky before the existentialism again sets in from a lack of direction (in which case you set more goals). In the worst case, achievement of the goal gives nothing but the realization that the goal you set in the past either lacked ambition or was the wrong goal to strive for (yikes). I want to suppose that reframing life direction around a "preferred reality" could be more productive than goal-setting where enjoyment, satisfaction, and fulfillment are rewarded in these fickle intervals. 

A preferred reality is a constant pursuit towards (or maintenance of) a defined set of "parameters" by which you *prefer* to experience consciousness. In simpler terms, a specific way you desire to live life. I believe this provides more value to an individual seeking direction, purpose, and fulfillment because you're not delaying self-satisfaction until some point in the future&ndash; where there are unforeseen new circumstances and information.[[1.1]](#11) Defining a preferred reality gives you a frame of which to guide your life by. The beauty of preferred realities is that, unlike goals, you can change parameters guiltlessly as you gain new information. There is also no shame in feeling content in the present moment&ndash; even if you haven't yet achieved a goal. As long as you're living in accordance with your preferred reality, there should be no substantial feelings of lack or inadequacy.[[1.2]](#12) The parameters you define in your preferred reality are completely up to you. They can range from abstract virtues to concrete daily rituals you engage in. Clearly, the more parameters you define, the more direction you give yourself moment to moment.[[1.3]](#13) One drawback (or feature) of this framework is that this system is inherently more demanding. As the variables in your life change, and they inevitably will, you will need to edit the persistent store where you documented these parameters (journal, digital document, etc.). This is constitutionally different from goal-setting where you're making a commitment to a direction set in the past.

**My preferred reality**

1. Health in body and mind.

    It should go without saying that health in body and mind is prerequisite to any satisfaction, enjoyment, or fulfillment that an individual may experience. Being generally satisfied with the state of your physical health, fitness, and mental condition make achievement in the following categories infinitely more probable.

    sine qua nons:

    - Participation in intense, challenging exercise (strength and cardiovascular training) 5-8 hours per week. 

    - Reasonable upkeep of hygiene and physical appearance.

    - Limiting digital or predatory media as there are immoral qualities inherent in its function and purpose. 

    - Exercising self-compassion. 

2. Pursuit of ambitious goals[[1.4]](#14).

    Chasing a northern star lying outside the boundaries of what you're confident you can achieve (given current abilities) has been the absolute best way for me to give energy and purpose to life. Evocative of the main thesis behind Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience*[[1.5]](#15), operating within the narrow confines of what you can and can't do is a wonderful source of true enjoyment and fulfillment. "He not busy being born is busy dying." - Bob Dylan

    sine qua nons:

    - There should be a nontrivial amount of uncertainty when setting sights on an ambitious goal.

    - The behavior, environment, and mental framing should be designed in accordance with the pursuit of these goals. 

    - Minimization of distractions which deter from achieving ambitious goals should be practiced. 


3. Love and genuine, meaningful relationships.

    Existence without love is devoid of meaning. Fostering genuine relationships with other people not only satisfies instinctual needs in our homo sapien biology (we're incredibly social creatures), but fulfills implicit social contracts in society&ndash; please allow me to explain. Having a genuine relationship with another individual who genuinely *sees* you is a beautiful thing. By nurturing such a relationship, you are promising witness to another's life and vice versa. This other person (spouse, close friend, family member, etc.) can acknowledge and validate the highlights, hardships, and interstitial events of one's life. It is my hypothesis that the more of these connections one can make, the more fulfillment and meaning present in one's life. Our existence is fleeting and insignificant. We are starting from zero on the proverbial scale of significance. Having a person (or people) to witness your existence is incredibly important. Inherent in any healthy relationship however is an implicit contract where this testimony is mutually upheld. 

    sine qua nons:

    - Always maintain a disposition of service and charity to those around you. 

    - Make room for genuine relationships by removing those which are parasitic, superficial, and insincere. 

    - Be always polite and kind. 


4. Voracious consumption of novel or interesting information.

    I cannot and do not desire to imagine a reality where the information, knowledge, and wisdom I currently hold is all I will possess for the rest of my life. Additionally, continuous learning of novel and/or interesting information is *extremely* enjoyable. Besides a very finite number of instances, more knowledge and a greater perspective are positive-sum profits.[[1.6]](#16) I genuinely believe that a greater store of knowledge, a wider perspective, and diverse experiences grant an elevated level of both consciousness and autonomy. 

    sine qua nons:

    - Ingestion of information, perspectives, and experiences from high quality sources[[1.7]](#17) need to be **daily** practice.

    - Nurturing a child-like curious nature and continual quenching of persistent curiosities.


5. Accrual and improvement of skills.

    Accrual and improvement of skills can be redefined into what they actually are: a transformation of one's abilities. I believe that a sincere confidence[[1.8]](#18) in one's abilities and an extensive reservoir of skills does well to increase the domain of one's autonomy. This parameter can also be thought of as an offspring of "the pursuit of ambitious goals" & "voracious consumption of novel or interesting information". Traits inherited from the former are the stretching of one's current faculties to encompass greater abilities. Traits inherited from the latter manifest as refusal to accept a reality where your current self is the upper limit of all you can do, know, or understand.  

    sine qua nons:

    - Always be pursuant in some interesting personal project.[[1.9]](#19)

    - Within reason, continue to stretch your skills to a degree of uncomfortability in which improvement can occur. 


6. Introspective analysis and evaluation against nobler ideals. 

    At this moment in my life, I do not subscribe to any of the existing religious dogma or texts (Bible, Quran, Torah, etc.). As a result it can be difficult to ignore and/or submit the lower, animalistic impulses and behaviors present in my biology.[[1.10]](#110) In my experience, surrender to these lower impulses has degraded my overall happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment. Unfortunately for homo sapiens, many of these lower impulses produce a drive towards practices of instant gratification&ndash; which almost always incur a less obvious negative consequence. In order to circumvent this paradox of human nature where there are proverbial weights constantly dragging us down as we march upwards to higher concepts like fulfillment and enjoyment, I have placed periodic internal inspection, and self-evaluation against ideals like discipline, wisdom, and accountability as parameters in my preferred reality. 

    sine qua nons: 

    - A regular journaling practice to decompose and uncover thoughts.

    - Compassionate evaluation against noble ideals.

7. Service and charity to the less fortunate.

    As a blessed individual, it is my responsibility to never neglect the less fortunate division of society. No person should be so naive or ignorant as to believe every gift in their life was given only through their own self-fueled toils. To rectify the unfairness in this truth, you should extend your time, energy, and resources when possible. 

    sine qua nons:

    - Be generally of service to those around you.

- Health in body and mind.

- Pursuit of ambitious goals.

- Love and genuine, meaningful relationships.

- Voracious consumption of novel or interesting information.

- Accrual and improvement of skills.

- Introspective analysis and evaluation against nobler ideals. 

- Service and charity to the less fortunate.


**Sine qua nons**

- Participation in intense, challenging exercise (strength and cardiovascular training) 5-8 hours per week. 

- Reasonable upkeep of hygiene and physical appearance.

- Limiting digital or predatory media as there are immoral qualities inherent in its function and purpose.

- A regular journaling practice to decompose and uncover thoughts.

- Compassionate evaluation against noble ideals.

- Be generally of service to those around you. 



#### 1.1 

This point I forgot to mention regarding the deficiencies of goal-setting. Setting goals within a context (the present or past) where you inevitably have incomplete information (cannot predict what will change about your circumstances) is a fundamental flaw&ndash; especially the farther into the future a goal is. 


#### 1.2 

If you are, then you are definitionally not living within your preferred reality (unless a masochistic tendency is part of your preferred reality).


#### 1.3 

"I want to be polite" is less informative than "I want to make the lives of those in my community better by always engaging an attitude of service to others".


#### 1.4

Seemingly contradictory to many of points I've been building in this essay, this reframes fulfillment around the *pursuit* of ambitious goals, not the *achievement* of them. In this context, you can be thoroughly content with your current state. Whereas before, you would be getting ahead of yourself.


#### 1.5

As defined in the book, a flow state is achieved by deep absorption in challenging activities that perfectly match one's skills leading to profound enjoyment, growth, and control over consciousness.


#### 1.6 

Positive-sum profit in the sense that there are no downsides or drawbacks incurred in its obtainment. 


#### 1.7 

Literature, oration, discussion, and the visual medium produced by credible and enduring entities (individuals or organizations).


#### 1.8

Sincere confidence in the sense that it is not performed for social validation/approval but genuinely within the boundaries of one's ability.


#### 1.9 

I have found that project-based or project-led learning has been the best way for me to maintain a level of interest in a topic while actually accruing skills. 


#### 1.10

Ranging from tendencies like greed and aggression to behaviors like the overconsumption of sugary foods and laziness.


## On Selecting A Career

Before delving into career selection, it's worthwhile to define the modern meaning of "career". Careers in the 21st century are offering less and less stability:

"Thus, it is clear from these median tenure results that workers will be faced with many decision points about their retirement benefits along their career paths, as workers will most likely not be with one company their entire career." - [EBRI](https://www.ebri.org/content/trends-in-employee-tenure--1983-2024)

Inversely, the variability in knowledge and/or skills required over the course of a career has increased (particularly in technology).[[2.1]](#21) Many jobs today are done in tandem with computers. The paradigms and abstractions of the software[[2.2]](#22) through which these job functions are executed have been relatively dynamic.[[2.3]](#23)

A career can produce many things for a human life. It can become the source of nearly all one's social interaction. It can bestow abundances of financial resources. It can, and most likely will be the largest consumer of your time. A career can give meaning and fulfillment, or it can be a reminder of your insignificance. This is why selecting a career should be as nontrivial a decision as they come. Its importance lies within the same realm as selecting a spouse or a location to raise a family. 

My career should have at least *the potential* to afford financial independence and abundance. It should allow a reasonable degree of autonomy. Its implications should be interesting and significant. Its execution should be nontrivial. I do not desire to work in a vacuum. There should be new experiences and people inherent in the kind of work it entails. With these preferences stated, I will consult OpenAI's GPT-5.2 LLM as these tools have proved excellent as natural language interfaces for collecting, parsing, and elegantly presenting the world's knowledge.

"

While this information is very valuable for our purposes, it can also be meaningless without context. The elements of a career or discipline that an individual finds interesting[[2.4]](#24) can differ greatly depending on their life experiences. From this given list, the only bullet points worth interest to me would be (in order): 
 
- AI/ML Engineer
- Biomedical Data Engineer 
- Data Scientist
- Technical Product Strategist
- Management Consultant

**Insights**

It's apparent that there is some quality inherent to engineering disciplines that I find extremely interesting. I will try to define that here:

Exploration and discovery of the universe's laws and application of that knowledge for solving human problems, or building tools which accomplish the former, is a near infinite problem space. Additionally, the idea of taking the ground truths of physics and architecting reliable and efficient abstractions to bring the elements of the universe into the domain of human control is a fascinating exercise. 

Now that engineering has been selected as a discipline,[[2.5]](#25) it seems logical to detail what I find interesting about the top choices. Subcategories that underpin the above selections are:

- data's applications (AI/ML)
- human computer interaction (HCI)
- data's wisdom (insights)

With these subjects now outlined, I will again consult OpenAI's GPT-5.2 LLM for the retrieval of information about jobs encompassing these subcategories. 

Relevant response portion (in order of interest): 

-  Systems Architect for Large-Scale Intelligence Systems
-  Embedded ML Engineer (Edge AI Systems)
-  Knowledge Engineer / Applied Ontologist
-  Cognitive Systems Engineer / Human–AI Interaction Engineer
-  Computational Neuroscientist / NeuroAI Researcher
-  Scientific Machine Learning Researcher
-  Bioinformatics Engineer / Computational Genomics Engineer
-  Research Engineer in Human Augmentation Technologies

**Insights**

From this, I see that the human element of interest is not so much for the biological structures of humans, but the realized and possible uses that machines and computers have for humans. Technology is a tool, it should be understood, perceived, and utilized as no more than such. Evidently, I've cultivated a techno-humanistic philosophy[[2.6]](#26) in regards to technology. I'd like my societal contributions to advance this sentiment. 

**I think the current discipline I'm going down (AI/ML & data engineering and software architecture) is a wonderful entrypoint to a career. It fulfills the critical needs in any good career: it interests me, it has meaningful implications for greater society, an opportunity for financial independence, and a reasonable allowance for autonomy over my time, attention, and energy. Maintaining a philosophical and ethical element to my curiosities however is critical for keeping in view the larger picture of human-centered technology.**



#### 2.1

Particularly in the technology field, an increasingly ubiquitous discipline. 

#### 2.2 

Many careers which entail arithmetic or data manipulation have been greatly automated or abstracted away from direct interaction. 

Analysts (Office 365)
Designers (Figma)
Scientists (Python, simulation software)
Engineers (CAD)
Web Developers (JS Frameworks)


#### 2.3 

Though I will not explore it here, it could be interesting to ponder about what relationship the paradigms of our jobs have with the information being generated on Earth. As the human population grows, more and more of the Earth's energy is converted into human thought (with more and more accessible information to feed this thought). Beside computers which are a byproduct of the ideas coming from human thought, human brains have been the largest source of original ideas. Collectively, we are a computer made up of a colony of processing units trying to compute (uncover) the laws of the Universe and how to control them. 


#### 2.4 

We are spending a good deal of time on interests because interest is a precursor to curiosity. Curiosity is the precursor to motivation. Higher motivation can be a good indicator for other career considerations like financial earnings and autonomy. 


#### 2.5 

I actually don't think that engineering really narrows the range of problem spaces (jobs) that much. Engineering principles are omnipresent in nearly every job from construction work to chief financial officers. Engineering is essentially the discipline for solving nontrivial problems, and many successful "solving models" have been produced as a result. 

#### 2.6 

Google Query Response LLM:

a philosophy seeing technology as a tool to enhance human potential, well-being, and evolution, merging humans with tech (like AI, biotech) to overcome biological limits for greater intelligence, longer life, and flourishing, often linked with transhumanism but emphasizing ethical frameworks and human values in this progress.


## A Perfect ML System

This essay is actually being done in service of a project I'm working on. It has been my most challenging project to this point (I've had to restart several times). The essence of the project is a CLI tool for the workflow orchestration of XGBoost projects. I've selected this as my next project for several reasons: 

1. I've never created an application interfaced with through the command line, yet I always use CLI tools. 

2. As an aspiring MLOps & AI/ML engineer I want to start getting experience with the process of deploying and monitoring models. 

3. If done right, it could be a fun project that also has value. 

4. I've never dealt with gradient-boosted models but I know they are frequently used in production. 

Defining the "perfect" ML system could clarify design and development choices. My hope is that this project will be something I'd be proud to share with more experienced engineers.

Before diving into the details however, it seems prudent to first state the obvious. I am not a professional engineer. I've been actively learning about data, software, and machine learning for a little over a year. My judgements will be limited by the narrow breadth of my knowledge and shallow depth of my experience. 

The perfect machine learning system should uphold all of the core pillars of good software (and really engineering): reliability, maintainability, and scalability[[3.1]](#31) as defined by Martin Kleppman in *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*. Now I will define in the best terms I can what the "perfect" ML system does under these constraints. 

**Reliability**

The perfect ML system should fundamentally *work*. This is actually a difficult feat for nontrivial problems in engineering. The system should accomplish its intended task with high consistency and at least reasonable performance&ndash; no more, no less. It uses each of its supplied resources (data, compute, energy, etc.) with utmost efficiency, greatly adding to performance, consistency, and simplicity. These aforementioned constraints should remain valid in a dynamic environment where unpredictable events happen. Just like how a car should still turn on reliably in the freezing cold and the sweltering heat.[[3.2]](#32) 

**Maintainability**

Solutions to hard problems can manifest in very different ways. Even for one person, their source code can look very different month to month or year to year. Good documentation and a consistent implementation[[3.3]](#33) can go a long way to make software more maintainable. It can be very time consuming to puzzle codebases into a working mental model from scratch. 

The above section talked about the responsibility of engineers to make later development as easy as possible. There are multiple facets to maintainability however. Operation of the application should be seamless, intuitive, and observable. Telemetry is critical, especially in ML systems. Because of the nondeterministic and enigmatic nature of machine learning models, engineers should have the ability to view the critical metrics a model is associated with. Automatic tooling for alerting the potential or immediate stresses in the system should be included. Most importantly, telemetry into whether a model is accomplishing its intended task without extra consequences. Engineers have implicitly agreed to trust a model's outputs by relinquishing decision making logic to invisible weights, biases, and statistical probabilities. It is essential that engineers validate this confidence by tracking metrics like data drift, model drift, model bias, and model performance within its context.[[3.4]](#34)


**Scalability**

For my specific project, scalability in users is not so much a concern as scalability in data. The perfect machine learning system will predictably be able to reliably store and elegantly handle large volumes of data. By elegant, I mean that the performance and operability are maintained with a reasonably large amount of data. 


With these pillars defined, my ensuing project(s) should try to uphold these constraints as best as possible.

#### 3.1 

There are obviously other pillars worth acknowledging such as performance and security. For the simplicity and brevity of this essay, we'll assume these more specified concepts fall under the current umbrella (ie. performance falls under scalability and security under maintenance).


#### 3.2 

Reliability has actually become one of the most important qualities in all technology I purchase now. When a tool or technology solves a problem in an intuitive way reliably, it is a beautiful thing. It removes the friction in its use and almost becomes magical when you consider the fault tolerances embedded in its design. 

#### 3.3 

Consistent implementation in the sense that the paradigms (object-oriented, functional, etc.) and style (function naming, indentations, etc.) should follow an intuitive pattern through a project. 

#### 3.4 

The context of the algorithm and application of machine learning greatly influences which metric to optimize for. 



## Tolerating the Right Imperfections 

*"You can do anything, but not everything." - David Allen*

While reading *Hidden Potential* by Adam Grant, I came across the following lines while he talked about the role imperfection played in the career of a famous Japanese architect by the name of Tadao Ando: 

"We usually associate aesthetic and technical prowess with a drive for
flawless results. As I’ve studied the habits of great designers, dancers, and
divers, though, I’ve come to understand that unlocking hidden potential is
not about the pursuit of perfection. Tolerating flaws isn’t just something
novices need to do—it’s part of becoming an expert and continuing to gain
mastery. The more you grow, the better you know which flaws are
acceptable." - Adam Grant 

This passage struck a chord. It's one of the truths I've come to appreciate in the acquisition or improvement of skills and/or behaviors. 

There are not many absolute generalizations that can be made about all people, let alone all organisms, on Earth. One that can be made is that we are all given 24 hours a day. Yet, outcomes vary greatly from person to person. This of course is due to an innumerable array of factors like socio-economic status, health, civil rights, and desires. The biggest influencer of outcomes however &ndash;in my naive opinion&ndash; is the management and prioritization of time and energy. People from all manner of circumstances have been able to accomplish their dreams given enough desire and luck, especially in the United States of America. Google "rags to riches stories" to see my supporting evidence. The way in which you elect to use your finite time, I will assert, is the largest indicator of the type of person you become and what you'll accomplish.

Tolerating the right imperfections is a critical skill under the constraints of limited time. Chasing perfection is fundamentally a losing game. Unless you're solving trivial problems, there will be tradeoffs and decisions made with limited information. The ability to prioritize, or to tolerate the right imperfections, is key to becoming a great problem-solver. Not every software operation can be in [constant time](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/). Not every element of a business can be perfectly efficient (especially with the added constraints of money and talent). Optimize for what's most important, and accept good enough for the rest. 

growth > perfection


Bill Gates was not the only person born October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington. What placed him at the head of a $3.64 trillion organization as of December 2025? Luck? There is a [philosophical argument](https://orionphilosophy.com/free-will-vs-determinism/) for that, but a much more productive perspective is looking at how he has spent his time. Gates initially **chose** to spend countless hours experimenting with and learning about computer software. He subsequently spent countless hours building what's proved to be an enduring business that transformed the world of personal computers and commercial software. The likelihood of Microsoft happening would have been greatly reduced had Gates chose to also divide his time with chasing Wimbledon (he liked tennis growing up). 

The lesson to be extrapolated from this anecdote is that there will be shortcomings, inadequacies, flaws...imperfections that have to be tolerated. The key is to select which components of the solution space you allow to be imperfect with respect to your desired outcomes and constraints. 

Do not let the unnecessary, unreasonable, and impossible standard of perfection get in the way of accomplishing your preferred reality. 



## The Grasp of a Craft 

**Entries**

- [Stack vs. the Heap](#stack-vs-heap-142026)
- [Interpreted vs. Compiled vs. JIT](#interpreted-vs-compiled-vs-jit)


This essay entry will contain all of my explanations and deliberations on various ideas and concepts relating to the following fields:

- The movement, processing, and applications of data
    - Networking
    - Distributed Systems
    - Machine Learning
- Software concepts 
    - Cloud Computing
    - Scalable Architecture (databases, caches, proxies, containerization, etc.)
    - Maintainable Architecture (monitoring, operability, microservices, etc.)
    - Backend logic (middleware, authentication, authorization, etc.)


In the words of Paul Graham, best known for his [essays](https://paulgraham.com) & Y Combinator, 

    "Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing." - How To Do Great Work

Writing, as a human invention, is in contention for one of the best ever. It's ability to preserve human thought and information over distance and time have been one of the greatest  accelerators of human progress. Think of where religion would be without scripture. Commerce without contracts. Try human knowledge without books. 


Writing has immense value at the individual level as well. Graham encapsulates this fact well in the above quote. By attempting to define concepts and their applications, I will be forced to rectify those subtle gaps in my knowledge. The specificity in these explanations will vary depending on my natural interest to the subject and proximity in relevance to the field of MLOps. 

Most to all entries should follow this formula:

$$
\text{Motivations} \rightarrow \text{Current Understanding} \rightarrow \text{Explanation} \rightarrow \text{Deliberations}
$$

Thinking about my current understanding prior to research will highlight gaps. This will ideally make research more targeted and impactful. 


### Stack vs. Heap 1/4/2026

The system which manages the allocating and deallocating of computer memory seems like a pretty important concept to understand as someone aspiring to program computers. The biggest adjustment from Python (1st language) to Rust & Golang has been understanding how information is stored and manipulated for compiled languages. Up to this point, I've become familiar with the higher level data structures & algorithms (maps, linked lists, and trees). This new knowledge will hopefully continue to reinforce my current mental model of programming. 

**Current Understanding**

I understand the stack as the structure which manages defined aspects of a program. Initialized primitives, functions, and their respective scopes are pushed and popped from the stack element. I'm not certain whether values or address are stored on the stack. The stack operates on the LIFO (last in first out) principle to handle the sequential nature of programming. 

The heap manages the parts of a program which can not be defined with certainty at the time of compilation. I imagine that custom abstractions and external input are handled by this concept. I imagine that there are two core components to a heap. The component which allocates and deallocates memory and the other which tracks the addresses of the underlying data. I also know there to be a tree data structure somewhere in the heaps implementation.

The memory layout of a C++ program is probably the most useful convention to study, so the resource explored that one. A program is given an address or memory space during execution. The range of addresses vary depending on the machine. Within this memory space, defined information is stored in the "low" addresses: the text instruction to run the program, the initialized (global) data, and uninitialized data. Much of the rest of the memory space is left to the stack and heap structures for allocating and deallocating memory. However stack and heap grow towards each other. This makes intuitive sense when you imagine the memory space as a finite array or memory addresses. It would be extremely inefficient to have to shift the stack *or* the heap if one grew too large. On this note, if either the stack or heap hit their respective limit, an overflow error is raised. 

Variables placed on stack are called stack variables. At least for Go (the language I'm learning), any variable declared in a function (even main()) is considered to be "handled" by the stack. As it relates to programming, understanding scope, references, and argument passing conventions are greatly helped by understanding the stack. During the sequential execution, a program jumps in/out of many scopes. Keeping track of the addresses you need during programming is important. 

Unlike allocation of stack variables, which occurs automatically, heap memory needs to be explicitly allocated and deallocated. This process is done by the programmer, a garbage collector, or some other contract (Rust's borrow checker). Interestingly, the addresses of allocated data are still pushed onto the stack. This make intuitive sense. Because the stack needs to know the size of all its data (so returned values can go to the write location), a pointer has a predictable size depending on the machine architecture. 

This is as much as I'll dive into the stack & heap for now. The stack & heap lie at the basis of programmable computers. Without them, writing predictable programs would be much harder.
