## Goals vs. Preferred Reality

As I've gotten older, I have strayed further away from the practice of setting goals. There is undoubtedly still immense value inherent in setting direction for your life. I don't want that truth to be lost in this essay. My reasoning behind reframing this encapsulation around life direction from "goals" into "preferred reality" is that there are flaws inherent in goal-setting. In goal-setting and goal-achieving, a typical sequence of events would go as follows: you set a goal $\rightarrow$ you work towards this goal with industry $\rightarrow$ goal is achieved or not achieved. Assuming a goal is achieved, the following happens. In the best case, this means you will allow yourself to enjoy a brief moment of satisfaction and maybe even fulfillment if you're lucky before the existentialism again sets in from a lack of direction (in which case you set more goals). In the worst case, achievement of the goal gives nothing but the realization that the goal you set in the past either lacked ambition or was the wrong goal to strive for (yikes). I want to suppose that reframing life direction around a "preferred reality" could be more productive than goal-setting where enjoyment, satisfaction, and fulfillment are rewarded in these fickle intervals. 

A preferred reality is a constant pursuit towards (or maintenance of) a defined set of "parameters" by which you *prefer* to experience consciousness. In simpler terms, a specific way you desire to live life. I believe this provides more value to an individual seeking direction, purpose, and fulfillment because you're not delaying self-satisfaction until some point in the future&ndash; where there are unforeseen new circumstances and information.[[1.1]](#11) Defining a preferred reality gives you a frame of which to guide your life by. The beauty of preferred realities is that, unlike goals, you can change parameters guiltlessly as you gain new information. There is also no shame in feeling content in the present moment&ndash; even if you haven't yet achieved a goal. As long as you're living in accordance with you're preferred reality, there should be no substantial feelings of lack or inadequacy.[[1.2]](#12) The parameters you define in your preferred reality are completely up to you. They can range from abstract virtues to concrete daily rituals you engage in. Clearly, the more parameters you define, the more direction you give yourself moment to moment.[[1.3]](#13) One drawback (or feature) of this framework is that this system is inherently more demanding. As the variables in your life change, and they inevitably will, you will need to edit the persistent store where you documented these parameters (journal, digital document, etc.). This is constitutionally different from goal-setting where you're making a commitment to a direction set in the past.

**My preferred reality**

1. Health in body and mind.

    It should go without saying that health in body and mind is prerequisite to any satisfaction, enjoyment, or fulfillment that an individual may experience. Being generally satisfied with the state of your physical health, fitness, and mental condition make achievement in the following categories infinitely more probable.

    sine qua nons:

    - Participation in intense, challenging exercise (strength and cardiovascular training) 5-8 hours per week. 

    - Reasonable upkeep of hygiene and physical appearance.

    - Limiting of digital or predatory media as there are immoral qualities inherent in its function and purpose. 

    - Exercising self-compassion. 

2. Pursuit of ambitious goals[[1.4]](#14).

    Chasing a northern star lying outside the boundaries of what you're confident you can achieve (given current abilities) has been the absolute best way for me to give energy and purpose to life. Evocative of the main thesis behind Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience*[[1.5]](#15), operating within the narrow confines of what you can and can't do is a wonderful source of true enjoyment and fulfillment. "He not busy being born is busy dying." - Bob Dylan

    sine qua nons:

    - There should be a nontrivial amount of uncertainty when setting sights on an ambitious goal.

    - The behavior, environment, and mental framing should be designed in accordance with pursuit of these goals. 

    - Minimization of distractions which deter from achieving ambitious goals should be practiced. 


3. Love and genuine, meaningful relationships.

    Existence without love is devoid of meaning. Fostering genuine relationships with other people not only satisfies instinctual needs in our homo sapien biology (we're incredibly social creatures), but fulfills implicit social contracts in society&ndash; please allow me to explain. Having a genuine relationship with another individual who genuinely *sees* you is a beautiful thing. By nurturing such a relationship, you are promising witness to another's life and vice versa. This other person (spouse, close friend, family member, etc.) can acknowledge and validate the highlights, hardships, and interstitial events of one's life. It is my hypothesis that the more of these connections one can make, the more fulfillment and meaning present in one's life. Our existence is fleeting and insignificant. We are starting from zero on the proverbial scale of significance. Having a person (or people) to witness your existence is incredibly important. Inherent in any healthy relationship however is an implicit contract where this testimony is mutually upheld. 

    sine qua nons:

    - Always maintain a disposition of service and charity to those around you. 

    - Make room for genuine relationships by removing those which are parasitic, superficial, and insincere. 

    - Be always polite and kind. 


4. Voracious consumption of novel or interesting information.

    I cannot and do not desire to imagine a reality where the information, knowledge, and wisdom I currently hold is all I will possess for the rest of my life. Additionally, continuous learning of novel and/or interesting information is *extremely* enjoyable. Besides a very finite number of instances, more knowledge and a greater perspective are positive-sum profits.[[1.6]](#16) I genuinely believe that a greater store of knowledge, a wider perspective, and diverse experiences grant an elevated level of both consciousness and autonomy. 

    sine qua nons:

    - Ingestion of information, perspectives, and experiences from high quality sources[[1.7]](#17) need to be **daily** practice.

    - Nurturing a child-like curious nature and continual quenching of persistent curiosities.


5. Accrual and improvement of skills.

    Accrual and improvement of skills can be redefined into what they actually are: a transformation of one's abilities. I believe that a sincere confidence[[1.8]](#18) in one's abilities and an extensive reservoir of skills does well to increase the domain of one's autonomy. This parameter can also be thought of as an offspring of "the pursuit of ambitious goals" & "voracious consumption of novel or interesting information". Traits inhereted from the former are the stretching of one's current faculties to encompass greater abilities. Traits inhereted from the latter manifest as refusal to accept a reality where your current self is the upper limit of all you can do, know, or understand.  

    sine qua nons:

    - Always be pursuant in some interesting personal project.[[1.9]](#19)

    - Within reason, continue to stretch your skills to a degree of uncomfortability in which improvement can occur. 


6. Introspective analysis and evaluation against nobler ideals. 

    At this moment in my life, I do not subscribe to any of the existing religious dogma or texts (Bible, Quran, Torah, etc.). As a result it can be difficult to ignore and/or submit the lower, animalistic impulses and behaviors present in my biology.[[1.10]](#110) In my experience, surrender to these lower impulses has degraded over happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment. Unfortunately for homo sapiens, many of these lower impulses produce a drive towards practices of instant gratification&ndash; which almost always incurs negative consequences. In order to circumvent this paradox of human nature where there are proverbial weights constantly dragging us down as we march upwards to higher concepts like fulfillment and enjoyment, I have placed periodic internal inspection, and self-evaluation against ideals like discipline, wisdom, and accountability as parameters in my preferred reality. 

    sine qua nons: 

    - A regular journaling practice to decompose and uncover thoughts.

    - Compassionate evaluation against noble ideals.

7. Service and charity to the less fortunate.

    As a blessed individual, it is my responsibility to never neglect the less fortunate division of society. No person should so naive or ignorant as to believe every gift in their life was given only through their self-fueled toils. To rectify this unfair truth, you should extend your time, energy, and resources when possible. 

    sine qua nons:

    - Be generally of service to those around you.

#### 1.1 

This point I forgot to mention regarding the deficiencies of goal-setting. Setting goals within a context (the present or past) where you inevitably have incomplete information (cannot predict what will change about your circumstances) is a fundamental flaw&ndash; especially the farther into the future a goal is. 


#### 1.2 

If you are, then you are definitionally not living within you're preferred reality (unless a masochistic tendency is part of your preferred reality).


#### 1.3 

"I want to be polite" is less informative than "I want to make the lives of those in my community better by always engaging an attitude of service to others".


#### 1.4

Seemingly contradictory to many of points I've been building in this essay, this reframes fulfillment around the *pursuit* of ambitious goals, not the *achievement* of them. In this context, you can be thoroughly content with your current state. Whereas before, you would be getting ahead of yourself.


#### 1.5

As defined in the book, a flow state is achieved by deep absorption in challenging activities that perfectly match one's skills leading to profound enjoyment, growth, and control over consciousness.


#### 1.6 

Positive-sum profit in the sense that there are no downsides or drawbacks incurred in its obtainment. 


#### 1.7 

Literature, oration, discussion, and the visual medium produced by credible and enduring entities (invidiuals or organizations).


#### 1.8

Sincere confidence in the sense that it is not performed for social validation/approval but genuinely within the boundaries of one's ability.


#### 1.9 

I have found that project-based or project-led learning has been the best way for me to maintain a level of interest in a topic while actually accruing skills. 


#### 1.10

Ranging from tendencies like greed and aggression to behaviors like the overconsumption of sugary foods and laziness.


## On Selecting A Career

Before delving into career selection, it's worthwhile to define the modern meaning of "career". Careers in the 21st century are offering less and less stability:

"Thus, it is clear from these median tenure results that workers will be faced with many decision points about their retirement benefits along their career paths, as workers will most likely not be with one company their entire career." - [EBRI](https://www.ebri.org/content/trends-in-employee-tenure--1983-2024)

Inversely, the set of knowledge and/or skills required over the course of a career has increased.[[2.1]](#21) Many jobs today are done in tandem with computers. The paradigms and abstractions of the software[[2.2]](#22) through which these job functions are executed have been relatively dynamic, dependent on the triviality of the logic or data manipulation required (data engineer, game designer, etc.).[[2.3]](#23)

A career can produce many things for a human life. It can become the source of nearly all one's social interaction. It can bestow abundances of financial resources. It can, and most likely will be the largest consumer of your time. A career can give meaning and fulfillment, or it can be a reminder of your insignficance. This is why selecting a career should be as nontrivial a decision as they come. Its importance lies within the same realm as selecting a spouse or a location to raise a family. 

My career should have at least *the potential* to afford financial independence and abundance. It should allow a reasonable degree of autonomy. Its implications should be interesting and signficant. It's execution should be nontrivial. I do not desire to work in a vacuum. Their should be new experiences and people inherent in the kind of work it entails. With these preferences stated, I will consult OpenAI's GPT-5.2 LLM as these tools have proved excellent as natural language interfaces for collecting, parsing, and elegantly presenting the world's knowledge.

While this information is very valuable for our purposes, it can also be meaningless without context. The elements of a career or discipline that an individual finds interesting[[2.4]](#24) can differ greatly depending on their life experiences. From this given list, the only bullet points worth interest to me would be (in order): 
 
- AI/ML Engineer
- Biomedical Data Engineer 
- Data Scientist
- Technical Product Strategist
- Management Consultant

**Insights**

It's apparent that there is some quality inherent to engineering disciplines that I find extremely interesting. I will try to define that here:

Exploration and discovery of the universe's laws and application of that knowledge for solving human problems, or building tools which accomplish the former, is a near infinite problem space. Additionally, the idea of taking the ground truths of physics and architecting reliable and efficient abstractions to bring the elements of the universe into the domain of human control is a fascinating exercise. 

Now that engineering has been selected as a discipline,[[2.5]](#25) it seems logical to detail what I find interesting about the top choices. Subcategories that underpin the above selections are:

- data's applications (AI/ML)
- human computer interaction (HCI)
- data's wisdom (insights)

With these subjects now outlined, I will again consult OpenAI's GPT-5.2 LLM for the retrieval of information about jobs encompassing these subcategories. 

Relevant response portion (in order of interest): 

-  Systems Architect for Large-Scale Intelligence Systems
-  Embedded ML Engineer (Edge AI Systems)
-  Knowledge Engineer / Applied Ontologist
-  Cognitive Systems Engineer / Human–AI Interaction Engineer
-  Computational Neuroscientist / NeuroAI Researcher
-  Scientific Machine Learning Researcher
-  Bioinformatics Engineer / Computational Genomics Engineer
-  Research Engineer in Human Augmentation Technologies

**Insights**

From this, I see that the human element of interest is not so much for the biological structures of humans, but the realized and possible uses that machines and computers have for humans. Technology is a tool, it should be understood, perceived, and utilized as no more than such. Evidently, I've cultivated a techno-humanistic philosophy[[2.6]](#26) in regards to technology. I'd like my societal contributions to advance this sentiment. 

**I think the current discipline I'm going down (AI/ML & data engineering and software architecture) is a wonderful entrypoint to a career. It fulfills the critical needs in any good career: it interests me, it has meaningful implications for greater society, an opportunity for financial independence, and a reasonable allowance for autonomy over my time, attention, and energy. Maintaining a philosophical and ethical element to my curiosities however is critical for keeping in view the larger picture of human-centered technology.**



#### 2.1

Particularly in the technology field, an increasingly ubiquitous discipline. 

#### 2.2 

Many careers which entail arithmetic or data manipulation have been greatly automated or abstracted away from direct interaction. 

Analysts (Office 365)
Designers (Figma)
Scientists (Python, simulation software)
Engineers (CAD)
Web Developers (JS Frameworks)


#### 2.3 

Though I will not explore it here, it could be interesting to ponder about what relationship the paradigms of our jobs have with the information being generated on Earth. As the human population grows, more and more of the Earth's energy is converted into human brain matter (with more and more information made available). Besides, computers which are a byproduct of the ideas coming from brain matter, human brains have been the largest source of original ideas and information generation. Collectively, we are a growing computer trying to compute (uncover) the laws of the Universe and how to control them. 


#### 2.4 

We are spending a good deal of time on interests because interest is a precursor to curiosity. Curiosity is precursor to motivation. Higher motivation can be a good indicator for the other career considerations like financial earnings and autonomy. 


#### 2.5 

I actually don't think that engineering really narrows the range of problem spaces (jobs) that much. Engineering principles are omnipresent in nearly every job from construction work to chief financial officers. Engineering is essentially the discipline for solving nontrivial problems, and many successful "solving models" have been produced as a result. 

#### 2.6 

Google Query Response LLM:

a philosophy seeing technology as a tool to enhance human potential, well-being, and evolution, merging humans with tech (like AI, biotech) to overcome biological limits for greater intelligence, longer life, and flourishing, often linked with transhumanism but emphasizing ethical frameworks and human values in this progress.
